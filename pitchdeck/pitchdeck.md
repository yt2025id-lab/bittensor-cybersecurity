# AI Cybersecurity Network Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title & Tagline
- **Project Name:** AI Cybersecurity Network Subnet
- **Tagline:** Cybersecurity, Decentralized
- **Subtitle:** Real-time threat intelligence powered by Bittensor
- **Logo/Image:** [Insert project logo or cybersecurity/shield icon]

## Slide 2: Problem
- Cyber threats evolve rapidly; traditional detection is too slow and reactive.
- Security data is siloed across organizations with no incentive to share.
- Small businesses and Web3 projects lack access to enterprise-grade threat intelligence.
- Global cybercrime costs exceed **$10 trillion/year** by 2025 (Cybersecurity Ventures).
- **Image:** Hacker silhouette, data breach alerts, fragmented security dashboards.

## Slide 3: Solution
- Decentralized threat intelligence network on Bittensor.
- Security experts and AI models collaborate to detect, analyze, and mitigate threats.
- On-chain transparency ensures trust; $TAO rewards incentivize quality contributions.
- Open access to enterprise-grade cybersecurity for everyone.

## Slide 4: Market Opportunity
- Threat intelligence market: **$15.8B by 2026** (MarketsandMarkets).
- Cybersecurity spending: **$223B globally** (Gartner 2024).
- Web3 security incidents: **$3.8B lost in 2022** alone.
- Target segments: SMBs, DeFi protocols, DAOs, Web3 projects, enterprises.

## Slide 5: How It Works (Mechanism Design)
- **Step 1:** User submits a threat query (IP, URL, payload, log pattern).
- **Step 2:** Miners (security analysts/AI) analyze the threat and return risk level + mitigation.
- **Step 3:** Validators verify accuracy against known threat databases (CVE, MITRE ATT&CK).
- **Step 4:** Quality scores computed; $TAO rewards distributed proportionally.
- **Step 5:** All activity recorded on Bittensor blockchain for auditability.
- **Diagram:** Flow: Query -> Miners -> Analysis -> Validators -> Score -> Reward.

## Slide 6: Miner & Validator Design
- **Miner Tasks:**
  - Threat classification (malware, phishing, DDoS, exploit)
  - Risk scoring (1-10 severity)
  - Mitigation recommendations
  - Performance metric: True Positive Rate, Response Time
- **Validator Tasks:**
  - Cross-reference with CVE, MITRE ATT&CK, VirusTotal
  - Consensus scoring across multiple miners
  - Scoring formula: `Score = 0.6 * Accuracy + 0.3 * Speed + 0.1 * Detail`
- **Image:** Miner/Validator role diagram.

## Slide 7: Bittensor Integration & Incentives
- Runs as a dedicated Bittensor subnet.
- Miner Reward: `alpha * Accuracy * QueryReward`
- Validator Reward: `beta * ValidationScore * TotalReward`
- Staking mechanism for validator trust.
- On-chain reputation for long-term credibility.

## Slide 8: Competitive Advantage
- **vs CrowdStrike/Palo Alto:** Decentralized, open access, no vendor lock-in.
- **vs VirusTotal:** Incentivized contributions, real-time analysis, not just signature matching.
- **vs Web3 Security (Chainalysis):** Broader scope beyond blockchain, community-driven.
- **Moat:** Network effects - more miners = better detection = more users.
- **Image:** Competitive matrix table.

## Slide 9: Go-to-Market Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Launch subnet on Bittensor testnet; recruit initial security researchers.
- **Phase 2:** Partner with Web3 projects and DeFi protocols for real-time monitoring.
- **Phase 3:** Enterprise API offering; SIEM integration (Splunk, QRadar).
- **Phase 4:** Open marketplace for custom threat models and detection rules.
- **Channels:** Discord/Twitter community, hackathon demos, security conferences.
- **Image:** GTM roadmap timeline.
